FP principles can be applied to ensure that calculations are done using pure functions and immutable data, making it easier to manage the spreadsheet's state and handle concurrent user interactions. Many modern spreadsheet applications may incorporate elements from both paradigms to strike a balance between maintainability and performance.</p>
