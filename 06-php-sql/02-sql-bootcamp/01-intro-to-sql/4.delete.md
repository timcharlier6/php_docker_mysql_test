## DELETE FROM

`DELETE` allows you to update one or more rows corresponding to a condition (WHERE).

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE column_name OPERATOR "value"
[and|or "column_name" OPERATOR "value"];

[ ] = optional
```

**Note:** don't forget the WHERE clause when you DELETE, otherwise ALL the rows in the table will be **deleted**!

In our weather table, we finally decide to delete Bastogne because is not a big enough city to have in our datas : 


```sql
DELETE FROM weather
WHERE city = "Bastogne"
```
