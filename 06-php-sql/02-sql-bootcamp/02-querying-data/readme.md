# Querying data

- Repository: `NA`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning challenge`
- Duration: `2 days`
- Deployment strategy : `NA`
- Team challenge : `solo with sharing`

## Learning objectives
- Able to lookup information about sql on the web
- Able to query a complicated database schema and answer data questions

## The mission

With this exercise you can find an [SQL file](database/classicmodels.sql), you can import into a database.
To do this, **first create a new database in your database manager** to make sure you have the rights. Give it the name `classicmodels`. 

Then you can run a command to **import** your SQL file **without** foreign key checks.

It will import some tables in them, you will need those for the exercise.

The database `classicmodels` is a retailer of scale models of classic cars database. It contains typical business data such as customers, products, sales orders, sales order line items, etc.

With this exercice we'll ask you to perform some **sql queries** to be able to answer some questions. 

[Go the online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeF6M-zt991WTFA6u5K9ceeGGqMgmT3fJq42uckWrccRd5hMw/viewform) and try to answer all the questions.
Don't stress out, it is not a test, and you can try as often as you want! Also, **WRITE YOUR ANSWERS SOMEWHERE**, you might need those later ;)

Good luck!

> **Extra Info about the dabase : MSRP**
> Because our sample database is American it uses the abbreviation MSRP, short for *manufacturer's suggested retail price*.
The manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) is the price that a product's manufacturer recommends it is sold for at point of sale. The MSRP is also referred to as the list price by some retailers.

## The syntax: learning SQL

This [basic MySQL tutorial](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/basic-mysql-tutorial.aspx) explains some basic SQL statements. If this is the first time you have used a relational database management system, this tutorial teaches you everything you need to know to work with MySQL such as querying data, updating data, managing databases, and creating tables.

This is a selection of all interesting and common used ways of reading data out MySQL.
With the knowledge you will gain here, you will be able to answer all questions below!

    - [Subquery â€“ show you how to nest a query (inner query) within another query (outer query) and use the result of the inner query for the outer query.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-subquery/)
        
1. Joining tables
    - [Table & Column Aliases â€“ introduce you to table and column aliases.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-alias/)
    - [LEFT JOIN â€“ return all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table or null if no matching rows found in the right table.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-left-join.aspx)
