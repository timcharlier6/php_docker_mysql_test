# CREATE DB & TABLES

## Create a database

As we said, a database (or "db" for short) is essentially a name denoting a set of tables. Suddenly, the syntax is rather simple:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE db_name;
```

Typically, the name chosen corresponds to the name of the application motivating the creation of this db.

## Create tables

Creating a table consists in choosing a name for it (by convention, always in the plural since a table is intended to contain several elements). Then, you have to define the columns describing each useful characteristic of the object. It's a bit laborious: you have to specify a name and the type of data that the column will contain. The main types are:

- `VARCHAR(255)`: for short texts (255 characters or less). for ex: to store emails adresses.   
**Note:** If you are sure that all the values to be stored will have exactly the same number of characters, then use `CHAR (x)` (x being the number of characters) instead.
- `INT`: for numerical values (digits). For example: to store the size of a person's feet.
- `TEXT`: for long texts (for a" biographical "for example), Boolean, Number ("Integer"), etc. Try to understand this example:
- `DATE`: to store dates.

```sql
CREATE TABLE juniors
    (`promo` varchar(17), `firstname` varchar(15), `lastname` varchar(19), `gender` varchar(1), `birthdate` varchar(10), `age` int, `mail` varchar(29), `github` varchar(15))
;
```

To start, the best is to use a tool like PhpMyAdmin (we will see it soon !). It will allow you to visually manipulate your databases, while displaying the generated SQL query each time. It's a good way to learn.
