# INSERT INTO

Regularly, your tables will receive new rows.   

For example, let's take our example of the weather.

One day the city of Arlon decides that its meteorological information must also be found in your application. It will therefore follow the registration procedure, and at some point, her account will be created.

In SQL, this simply means that the application will have **added a row at the bottom of the table** by providing it with the information to insert in the columns.  

## Syntax INSERT INTO

To insert records into a table, write `INSERT INTO` followed by the name of the table, followed by an open parenthesis, followed by a list of column names **separated by commas** , followed by a closed parenthesis followed by `VALUES`, followed by The list of values in parentheses **'in the same order as the column order**, separated by a comma between each value. The values you enter will be kept in the rows and they will match the column names you specify. Each character string must be enclosed in single quotes. ex: `'character string'`, but not the numbers. ex: `28`

```sql
INSERT INTO
	table_name (column1, column2, column3 ... last_column)
VALUES
	(value_column_1, value_column2, ... value_last_column)
;
```
**Note:** Each character string must be enclosed in single quotes. ex: `'character string'`  

So in our example of weather, let's add a row for Arlon, where the maxima is 34 and the minima is 11.  

```sql
INSERT INTO weather
    (city, high, low)
VALUES
    ('Arlon', 34, 11);
```

## Exercise
Practice on the [learning sandbox](http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/d3b1c2). Use the **left** editable field below the creation of the table. (the right one only allows SELECT).

Then add your hometown (or another) and its min and max temperatures. Type the command each time (no copy / paste), so that the syntax fits in your fingers.

On the right field, `SELECT` the entire table to see if your city is added. 

There is nothing else special to know about this and you can move on to the next topic.
