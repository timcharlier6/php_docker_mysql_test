## The introduction

OOP - `Object Orientated Programming` - focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. 
This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.

## The objective

## An example

Let's say we have a list of animals from the zoo:
```js
const listOfAnimals = [
    {
        animalType : 'monkey',
        order : 'mammal',
        amount : 25
    },
    {
        animalType : 'donkey',
        order : 'mammal',
        amount : 3
    },
    {
        animalType : 'turkey',
        order : 'bird',
        amount : 500
    }
]
```

Instead of having to create this data ourselves in the format above, we can make use of OOP structures.
With OOP we would create a class `Animal`, that class will serve as some sort of "blueprint" for creating animals.
Think of it as similar to an object, but on steroids.

#### Step one: the blueprint (class)

This class has 3 important parts:
1. the public strings
   - the properties that your class will use.
2. The Constructor
    - The constructor is where your class will receive the data and apply it to the properties mentioned above
3. The functions
    - You can use functions to manipulate the data and have any result you want.

```php
<?php

class Animal = 
{
    // The Properties
    public $animalType;
    public $order;
    public $amount;
    
    // The Constructor with incoming parameters in the brackets
    public function __construct($animalType, $order, $amount)
    {
        // in a sentence it would be: "set this class's properties with the same value as the incoming parameters"
        $this->animalType = $animalType;
        $this->order = $order;
        $this->amount = $amount;
    };
    
    // The functions
    public function sayHelloToAnimal()
    {
        echo "Hello, $this->animalType";
    };
}
```
#### Step two: instantiating the object

For every object you want to create, you just need to instantiate a **new** object.

```php
<?php

$animal1 = new Animal("monkey", "mammal", 25);
$animal2 = new Animal("donkey", "mammal", 3);
$animal3 = new Animal("turkey", "bird", 500);
```
#### Step 3: use it!

Now that we created 3 animal objects. we can also start to use them in our code!

```php
<?php

$animal1->sayHelloToAnimal(); // Will result in: "Hello, monkey"
$animal2->sayHelloToAnimal(); // Will result in: "Hello, donkey"
$animal3->sayHelloToAnimal(); // Will result in: "Hello, turkey"
```

### Have fun!
