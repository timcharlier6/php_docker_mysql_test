# SELECT FROM

Most of the time, in CRUD jargon, you will want to do "Read", extract data from MySQL and then manipulate it in your PHP script.

This happens as follows: your PHP script a query formulated in SQL, and mysql returns an array with the results of the query. ([Here is a diagram](./assets/mysql-architecture.png) to understand the whole process of processing an http request, passing through Apache, PHP and MySQL).

For example, in the weather table your application wants to know what will be the maximum temperature in Li√®ge. To find out, it must "read" the cell in the "high" column of the "Li√®ge" row. If it is not clear, reread this sentence more slowly.

![](./assets/select-tb.png)

In SQL, this simply means that you will want to search for one or more rows of a well-defined table.  

So, in our example of the weather forecast, the query to formulate is: 

```sql
SELECT
high
FROM
weather
WHERE
city = 'Li√®ge';
```
which will return an array consisting of a cell, containing the requested value.

**Note:** Each request must end with `;`, as in PHP.  
**Note:** you can also write it in a single horizontal line. Either way, don't forget the semicolon at the end.

Column names following the **SELECT** keyword define the columns that will be returned in the results. You can select as many column names as you need, or use the `*` sign to select **all** columns.  

```sql
SELECT * FROM weather WHERE city = 'Li√®ge';
```

The name of the table following the **FROM** keyword specifies the table that will be queried to retrieve the desired results.

The **"WHERE" clause** is optional. It allows you to specify which values or rows of data will be returned or displayed, according to the criteria described after the keyword `WHERE`.

The **conditional** part (just after `WHERE`) can use these operators:

```sql
=	"equal to"
>	"greater than"
<	"less than"
>=	"greater than or equal to"
<=	"less than or equal to"
<>	"different from"
LIKE	"which looks like"
```
**Note Regarding `LIKE`**: it allows you to return rows which "looks like" a character string you specified, accompanied by the `%` sign, meaning "any string". For a computer, this means either:

- "which **begins** with *character_string*". (`LIKE 'Er%'`: any word starting with "Er"),  
- "which **ends** with *character_string*" (`LIKE '%Er'`: any word ending with "Er"),  
- or "which **contains** this *character_string*" (`LIKE '%Er%'`: any word containing "Er").  

This is very useful for adding search functionality to your app.

### SELECT Exercises

#### Drill 1
Go to our first [sandbox learning](http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/d3b1c2).

Use the editable area on the right to write your first SQL queries.  

Find the syntax to perform each of the following requests (read the wording carefully, each word is important!). Ready?

*Returns an array containing* 

1. *only cities*
1. *all cities and their maximum temperature*
1. *all cities and their minimum temperature*
1. *Where cities whose maximum temperature exceeds 27 degrees*
1. *Where cities with no minimum temperatures NOT equal to 15 degrees*
1. *Where cities with names beginning with "Br"*

Done? Did you do it all? So move on...


### SORT: ORDER BY
You can ask MySQL to sort the results according to an order you define. To do this, add at the end of your query: `ORDER BY` followed by the column to use for sorting, followed by either `ASC` ("ascending order", from A to Z for example or the least value at larger value) or `DESC` (" descending order ", from Z to A).

Ex:
```sql
SELECT city FROM weather ORDER BY city ASC;
```

### LIMIT THE NUMBER OF RESULTS

You can tell SQL to limit the number of results, by adding the keyword `LIMIT` followed by the starting row (we start at 0) then a comma, then the number of rows to keep.

For example, to keep only the top row, we add `LIMIT 0,1` to the query:

```sql
SELECT city FROM weather ORDER BY city ASC LIMIT 0,1;
````


#### Drill 2
Go to the second [learning sandbox](http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/43ebb3).

Familiarize yourself with this table first. What does it contain? what are the columns?
Then, same principle as above:

*Find the syntax to perform each of the following queries:*

1. *Displays the first and last name of all juniors, in ascending alphabetical order of the first name.*
1. *Displays the first and last names of all juniors, in descending alphabetical order of the last name. family.*
1. *Displays the first name, last name and age of all juniors, from youngest to oldest.*
1. *Displays the first name, last name and age of all juniors, from oldest to youngest.*
1. *Displays the first name, last name and age of all the juniors, from the youngest to older, from the jepsen-5 promo and whose age is between 23 and 28 years old.*


### FUNCTIONS
Here are two that we often use: **concat** and **count**. There are many more.

#### concat
It allows to concatenate columns to receive a table easier to process then in PHP.
For example, you can do this:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT (' city: ', city,': ', low,' / ', high) FROM weather;
```

#### count
Do you want to know how many cities there are in the table? You can simply query through SQL using the COUNT () function.

```sql
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM weather;
```

Do you want to check that there was not a double entry for Li√®ge? Use COUNT () and a WHERE clause to find out the number of times "Li√®ge" is found in the *weather* table.

```sql
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM weather WHERE city =' Li√®ge';
```
